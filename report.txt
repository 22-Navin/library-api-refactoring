This task focuses on improving the readability, structure, and performance of an existing Python Flask REST API. The original version of the application was functional but had areas where the code could be improved for better clarity, maintainability, and efficiency. The refactoring process involved reorganizing the code, improving naming conventions, reducing redundancy, and adding better error handling.

One of the main improvements was enhancing code readability. Function names were updated to clearly describe their purpose, making the application easier to understand. Docstrings were added to key functions to explain their behavior and expected output. This makes the code more maintainable and easier for other developers to read and modify in the future.

Repeated logic in multiple routes was identified and refactored into helper functions. This reduced code duplication and improved consistency across the application. Centralizing validation logic ensures that changes only need to be made in one place, which reduces the chance of errors.

Performance optimizations were also applied at a basic level. Unnecessary computations were removed, and conditional checks were simplified to improve execution flow. While the application is small, these changes help improve response handling and reduce overhead, especially as the application scales.

Error handling was improved by returning consistent JSON responses with appropriate status codes. This makes the API more predictable and user-friendly for clients consuming it. Overall, the refactoring process resulted in cleaner, more efficient, and more maintainable code while preserving the original functionality.

This task demonstrates the importance of writing clean and optimized code and highlights how even small improvements can significantly enhance the quality of a software project
